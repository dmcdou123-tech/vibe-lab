# Vibe Lab

This is my cross-platform coding workspace.

## Structure

- `swift/` — Xcode / iOS projects (Mac only)
- `python/` — Python tools and scripts (Mac or PC)
- `docs/` — notes, plans, and references

## Workflow

1. Write or update code with ChatGPT / Claude
2. Commit and push from Terminal
3. Pull and run on the correct machine

GitHub is the source of truth.
